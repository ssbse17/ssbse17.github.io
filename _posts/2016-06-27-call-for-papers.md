<b>9th International Symposium on Search Based Software Engineering (SSBSE 2017)  
co-located with ESEC/FSE'17 Paderborn, Germany, September 9-11, 2017   
http://ssbse17.github.io </b>

**Research Paper Track**

We invite the submission of high quality papers describing novel and original work in all areas of Search-Based Software Engineering including, but not limited to

-  applications of SBSE to novel problems, 
- theoretical analyses of search algorithms for software engineering, 
- rigorous empirical evaluations of SBSE techniques, 
- reports of industrial experiences. 

SSBSE welcomes not only applications from throughout the software engineering lifecycle but also a broad range of search methods ranging from:

- exact Operational Research techniques to 
- nature-inspired algorithms and simulated annealing. 

We particularly encourage papers that report on software engineering applications to which SBSE has not been applied before. 

Research papers must have up to 15 pages in length, including all text, figures, references and appendices. 

**Short Paper Track** 

We also invite short papers presenting new ideas, tools, experience reports, or novel techniques and ideas, which will be included in the proceedings and presented at the symposium. Papers submitted to this track should not exceed 6 pages in length using the regular symposium format. 

**Student Track** 

We also invite students to submit papers to a special Student track. This track gives students the opportunity to showcase their SBSE research and receive feedback from senior members of the SBSE community. Papers submitted to this track should not exceed 6 pages in length using the regular symposium format. To be eligible, papers should be primarily the work of students that have not yet completed their studies. The paper may have co-authors who are not students but the student author is expected to present the paper at the symposium. 

**SBSE Challenge Track** 

We challenge everyone interested in SBSE to apply tools, techniques, and algorithms to our selected problems. We want you to apply your SBSE expertise to do interesting things to or with the software and uncover interesting things related to it. The best competition entries will be awarded special prizes. Challenge papers should not exceed 6 pages in length using the regular symposium format. More details about the track will be announced on the website.

**Tutorials** 

2 page proposals for 1 hour tutorials covering state-of-the-art SBSE methods. Proposals must describe what will be presented and why this might be of interest to this community. Proposals will be selected on their novelty, technical content, track record of the presenter and, ideally, degree of interactivity with the audience.

**Transfer talks** 

Invited talks from authors publishing innovative work relevant to SBSE, originally presented at other forums. To nominate speakers for such talks, please email ssbse2017@easychair.org.

**Conference Proceedings** 

Accepted papers will be published in a volume of the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series (LNCS). 

**Best Paper Awards and Travel Grants**

Research and Student papers accepted for presentation at SSBSE 2017 will be considered for prizes. More details about prizes and travel grants will be announced on the website. 

**Special Section in IST for Best Papers** 

Following from the conference, a selection of best papers will be invited to submit extended versions for tentative publication in a Special Section of the journal of Information and Software Technology published by Elsevier http://www.elsevier.com/locate/infsof.
