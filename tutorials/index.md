<b>Title: Algorithms for Multiobjective Optimization and How to Benchmark Them</b>

<b>Abstract:</b>
Multiobjective optimization problems, in which two or more objective functions are to be optimized simultaneously, appear in many application domains. The field of search based software engineering is no exception.
Various algorithms for multiobjective optimization have been proposed in recent years, with the effect that the ultimate practical question when solving a concrete problem became increasingly difficult: which of the many available algorithm shall I actually use? To contribute to the answer of this question, we revisit several common multiobjective optimization algorithms in this talk and discuss their strengths and weaknesses from a more theoretical perspective. In addition, we look at the latest developments on how to benchmark (multiobjective) algorithms and showcase the performance of some common (and not so common) algorithms on the 55 unconstrained numerical blackbox functions of the biobjective BBOB test suite.

<b>Biography:</b> 
Dimo Brockhoff received his diploma in computer science from University of
Dortmund, Germany in 2005 and his PhD (Dr. sc. ETH) from ETH Zurich,
Switzerland in 2009. Later, he held two postdoctoral research positions in
France at Inria Saclay Ile-de-France (2009-2010) and at Ecole Polytechnique
(2010-2011) before joining Inria in November 2011 as a permanent researcher.
After working at Inria's Lille - Nord Europe research center for about five
years, he has been back to the Saclay - Ile-de-France center since October
2016 to become member of the new Randomized Optimization team.

His research interests are focused on evolutionary multiobjective
optimization (EMO), in particular on theoretical aspects of indicator-based
search, and on the benchmarking of blackbox algorithms in general. Dimo has
been involved in the co-organization of several special issues and workshops
around these topics such as the "SIMCO" and "SAMCO" workshops at the Lorentz
center in the Netherlands in 2013 and 2016 and the Blackbox Optimization
Benchmarking workshops at CEC 2015 and at GECCO 2013, 2015, and 2016.
