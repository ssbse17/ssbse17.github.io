With an intercity rail station in Bielefeld and an airport in Paderborn, OWL is also well-connected to local public transport.

There are magnificent natural areas to discover and enjoy in the Teutoburg Forest, Wiehen and Egge hills, on the Senne, and along the Weser, Ems, Pader, and Lippe rivers. There are excellent trails catering to recreational hikers and cyclists, and a great many interesting places to visit, including historic old towns, the Hermann Monument and the Externsteine rock formation.

Situated at the heart of Germany, midway between the Northern Lowlands and the mountainous central region, the charming city of Paderborn is full of many diverse and delightful attractions. The city has numerous qualities to tempt the visitor. With over 1,200 years of history to its credit, it is steeped in historical tradition, which has shaped the cityscape. The many parks and green spaces beginning right by the shopping precinct at Pader Springs are much appreciated by city-dwellers and visitors alike. Despite the recent modernization and expansion of the city, it remains a user-friendly place that can be easily navigated. In comparison with other cities, inhabitants have only a short distance to travel from home to work. Paderborn's appeal thus lies in the combination of many different qualities. Ancient and modern, sacred and spiritual, economic and political are all combined, each contributing to the city's distinctive character.

The Heinz Nixdorf MuseumsForum is the world’s largest computer museum, as well as a vibrant venue. The 5,000-year history, present and future of information technology is depicted over 6,000 m² of floor space, from the origins of numbers and characters in 3,000 B.C. all the way to the computer age of the 21st century. The 2,000-plus objects on show are presented within the broad context of social and economic history, making the exhibition appealing to laymen and computer experts alike. The extensive offering of events in the MuseumsForum complements the exhibition. Lectures, workshops and conferences focus on aspects of the far-reaching influence exerted by information technologies on both man and society at large. Thus the remit of the HNF is to address the issues of man’s guidance and education in the present-day information society.
