## Journal-First Presentations at SSBSE'17

SSBSE'17 is excited to present, for the first time in its history, _journal first publications_ at this conference. 

The goal of the _journal first_ program is  to provide a mechanism whereby research results that may be a better fit for publication via the journal review process can be broadly disseminated to the community through presentation in the technical research tracks of other technical conferences. As in other communities that provide a journal-first publication route (such as the VLDB conference in the database community), authors choosing this route benefit from the absence of page limits and annual submission deadlines, and the possibility of having their submissions undergo multiple rounds of review and revision.

In software engineering, the journal first program has gained considerable momentum in recent years. For example, now TSE has agreed to allow many such papers to be presented  at ICSE. 

Inspired by their lead, we are doing the same with SBSE-related papers. To qualify:

- The paper has to discuss SBSE material;
- The paper must not have appeared previous;
- The paper has to have appeared recently in a major journal;
- The editors of the journal must agree to such a _journal first_ presentation.

Applying this criteria, the SSBSE'17 PC co-chairs selected the following papers for _journal first_ presentation at SSBSE'17: 

- Roberto E. Lopez-Herrejon, Lukas Linsbauer, and Alexander Egyed. 2015. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infsof.2015.01.008" target="_blank">A systematic mapping study of search-based software engineering for software product lines</a>. Inf. Softw. Technol. 61, C (May 2015), 33-51. 

- Michael Mohan, Des Greer, and Paul McMullan. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2016.05.019" target="_blank">Technical debt reduction using search based automated refactoring</a>. Journal of Systems and Software 120 (2016): 183-194.

## Student Paper Track

This track gives students the opportunity to showcase their SBSE research and receive feedback from senior members of the SBSE community. To be eligible, papers should be primarily the work of students that have not yet completed their studies. The papers may have co-authors who are not students but the student author is expected to present the paper at the symposium.
